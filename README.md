# FDS Sanity Checker

## What is this?

FDS Sanity Checker is an opinionated validation tool for your [FDS](https://pages.nist.gov/fds-smv/) models.

It's easy to make mistakes when building FDS models, this tool attempts to sanity check them to make sure they at least produce useful results.

Try it out with this [couch model example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firemodels/fds/master/Verification/Fires/couch.fds) from github.
